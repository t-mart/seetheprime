# See The Prime

An unofficial companion page to [Say The Prime](https://saytheprime.com/), an
effort to collectively say the largest currently known prime number.

This page presents your assigned digits in a [ticker tape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_tape) design, which may be easier to read than lines of text.

See it in action at <https://seetheprime.vercel.app>.
